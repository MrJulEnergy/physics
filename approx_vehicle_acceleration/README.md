# approx_vehicle_acceleration
Approximate the Acceleration of a Vehicle if Power and some other Variables are given

The Differential Equation integrated in the script assumes a few things to simplify the ode. For example, the power of a real vehicle is a function of a lot of things (e.g engine speed, temperature, fuel mixture...) but this would "explode the frame" (go beyond the scope) of the approximation.
